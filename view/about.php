		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		TechFloor is a Student Organization that is devoted to the development of Computer Applications 
		that have the potential to make the campus a better place and advance members experience with program 
		languages and technologies. Any student with an interest in technology, specifically digital 
		technology, is welcome to join our group. Our group has a diverse set of interests such as web site 
		development, graphic design, gaming, digital photography, digital film, database applications, PC 
		maintenance and repair, networking, and much more.

		TechFloor is more than just a group of Computer Science and Information Science Majors because projects 
		involve more than just software engineering. Areas needed for upcoming projects include Public 
		Relations, Advertising, Statistical Analysis, Graphic Arts, Drawing, Programming, Network Management,
		Database Management and Digital Video Editing.
