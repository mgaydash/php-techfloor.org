				<h3>Welcome!</h3>
				This site contains information about our group and the many projects we as a group have provided for 
				Clarion University. If you have any questions or comments please feel free to contact us or join in 
				on the public discussion of projects at meetings and on our forum. If you are interested in 
				becoming a member or simply wish to learn more about the group you can join us every Thursday at 
				7:30 P.M. in room 10 Nair.

				Enter at the North Campus Desk. The North Area Desk is located in Nair Hall. Walk straight down the
				hall past the elevators, through the rec room double doors and then hang a right. You will see the 
				techfloor sign on the door and the number '10' on the door in front of you. That's us! Saturdays 
				there is usually a LAN party often mixed with project development and there is no need to bring your 
				own computer, we have plenty to go around. You can click on the TechCam link to your left and if 
				the lights are on we are there, feel free to join us. We won't bite.
				
				<h3>Keep in mind, we are UNDER CONSTRUCTION</h3>
